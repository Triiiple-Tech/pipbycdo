# PIP AI Project - GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
PIP AI is a comprehensive construction document analysis platform with FastAPI backend, React/TypeScript frontend, and agent-based architecture for processing construction documents and generating cost estimates.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with agent-based processing
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **External APIs**: Smartsheet integration
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT models with intelligent routing

## Key Agents
1. **FileReaderAgent**: Document processing and text extraction
2. **ScopeAgent**: Project scope analysis and categorization
3. **TakeoffAgent**: Quantity takeoff calculations
4. **TradeMapperAgent**: Trade classification and mapping
5. **EstimatorAgent**: Cost estimation and pricing
6. **QAValidatorAgent**: Quality assurance and validation
7. **ExporterAgent**: Data export and formatting
8. **ManagerAgent**: Orchestration and workflow management

## Development Patterns

### Agent Implementation
- Use async/await for all agent operations
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Include comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Follow dependency injection patterns
- Use TypedDict for structured data exchange

### API Endpoints
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implement proper error handling with detailed messages
- Include authentication and authorization
- Add comprehensive API documentation

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management with context
- Follow atomic design principles
- Include loading states and error boundaries
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Construction Industry Context
- Focus on commercial construction projects
- Support multiple document types (plans, specs, takeoffs)
- Handle various trade categories (electrical, mechanical, etc.)
- Integrate with industry-standard pricing databases
- Export to common formats (Excel, Smartsheet, etc.)

## Code Quality Standards
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Implement comprehensive test coverage
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Implement proper error handling throughout

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for large document processing
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use lazy loading for UI components
- Minimize API calls with efficient data fetching
- Handle concurrent agent processing

## Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
