PIP AI — Next-Level UI/UX Refactoring Directives
1. Don’t Just Scaffold—Bring the Vibe
* Every new component should reflect the “modular agents” concept:
    * Message bubbles = agent avatars, color accents, and animated entry.
    * Sidebar = glassy, modern, with glowing accent for active tab.
    * Every “status” (Ready, Parsing, Error) = pulsing badges, not just colored text.
2. Key Visual/Interactive Must-Haves
* Sidebar (Sidebar.jsx):
    * Active tab glows with accent color, icon animates on hover.
    * Collapsed mode = glass pill with icons only (hover expands).
* Chat Window (ChatWindow.jsx & MessageBubble.jsx):
    * Bubbles animate in (slide/fade/bounce).
    * Different color/shape/mini-icon per agent.
    * User input floats, with clear attach/send controls.
    * Show “typing…” for agents if latency is high.
* Files Tab (FilesTab.jsx):
    * Each file is a card/pill, not just a table row.
    * Status badges animate (e.g., shimmer or pulse for “Parsing”).
    * On error: shake animation, actionable error (e.g., retry or info tooltip).
    * Drag & drop zone overlays tab on hover/drag.
* Smartsheet Tab (SmartsheetTab.jsx):
    * Sheet loads with a skeleton shimmer.
    * Previews have “analyze”/“view”/“download” CTAs with icon buttons.
    * Error banners are friendly and dismissible.
* History Tab (HistoryTab.jsx):
    * Sessions are cards in a timeline, hover preview, tag/star feature.
    * Re-open loads session, restores context.
3. Smart Microinteractions
* Buttons animate on hover (scale up or color pulse).
* Sending a message animates send icon (arrow whooshes out).
* When an agent finishes processing, confetti or checkmark appears briefly.
4. Polish and Brand Layer
* Typography: Inter or Satoshi for headings, DM Sans or Helvetica Neue for body.
* Accent Color: Use a vivid brand color (e.g., #9147ff purple) for actions, glows, badges, but keep the background low-contrast.
* Shadows: Soft shadows behind floating elements (input bar, sidebar, file cards).
* Accessibility: Ensure tab order, focus rings, ARIA for all major actions.
5. Flow/UX Priorities (what must feel great before MVP demo):
1. Chat Input + Message Bubble Experience
    * Feels modern, agent-driven, responsive.
    * Animated bubble entry, agent avatars/icons, color-coded messages.
2. Files Tab Interaction
    * File pills, animated parse states, intuitive drag-and-drop overlay.
3. Sidebar Polish
    * Glowing active tab, smooth collapse/expand, glassmorphism.
4. General Error Handling
    * All errors in chat or file cards are user-friendly, actionable, never dead ends.

Quick Mood Board References
* Linear.app for sidebar & glass layering
* Notion for card modals & clean info hierarchy
* Discord/Slack for chat bubble design and agent avatar color coding
* Superhuman for microinteractions, keyboard-first workflow
* Vercel dashboard for file previews and drag/drop zones

Final tip: “Don’t treat this as a CRUD admin app. Treat it like a sleek, multi-agent command center—make the user feel like they’re orchestrating a team of smart bots, not just using a form.”

Let me know if you want word-mockups or exact behavioral specs for any interaction! (E.g., “Describe the send-message animation in detail,” or “What should happen when you drag a file over the drop zone?”)
