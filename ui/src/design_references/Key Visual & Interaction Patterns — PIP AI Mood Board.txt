Key Visual & Interaction Patterns — PIP AI Mood Board

1. Linear.app — Sidebar & Glass Layering
Color Scheme:
* Ultra-light backgrounds, subtle gradients
* Main accent (e.g., purple, blue) for active/focus states
* Neutrals: slate, soft gray, occasional black for contrast
Sidebar Pattern:
* Floating effect: Sidebar isn’t flush, but hovers with a soft shadow
* Glassmorphism: Semi-transparent, frosted background (blur behind)
* Active tab: Glows (colored border/halo), icon pulses on hover
* Collapse/expand: Chevron or hamburger at bottom, shrinks sidebar to icons-only, expands on hover/click
Interaction:
* On hover: tabs subtly scale up (1.05x), glow effect
* Sidebar remains always accessible, but never heavy or distracting
Typography:
* Modern geometric sans (e.g., Inter, Satoshi), bold for headings, medium/light for tab labels

2. Notion — Card Modals & Clean Info Hierarchy
Card/Modal Style:
* Cards: Rounded corners, gentle drop shadows, white or off-white backgrounds
* Modals: Subtle border (or none), content centered, generous padding
* Hierarchy:
    * Bold/large titles
    * Muted subtext
    * Key info (like file names/status) gets more weight/color
* Spacing: White space is generous; elements “breathe”
Interaction:
* Modals fade/slide in (not abrupt)
* Cards lift slightly on hover
Typography:
* Clean sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica Neue)
* Size: titles ~2rem, body ~1.2rem, never cramped

3. Discord / Slack — Chat Bubble & Avatar Design
Bubble Style:
* User Bubbles: Right-aligned, deep color fill (slate, blue, etc.), white text
* Agent Bubbles: Left-aligned, unique accent per agent (green for estimator, purple for manager, etc.), color-coded avatars or icons inside bubble or next to it
* Grouping: Consecutive messages from same sender grouped, last bubble has a tail
Interaction:
* Bubbles animate in—slide up/fade in
* Hover on message: timestamp appears, subtle highlight around bubble
* Mentions (e.g., @manager, @file.pdf) are colored, clickable
Avatars:
* Round, bold background color per agent type, simple icon (robot, doc, ruler, etc.)
Typography:
* Body: readable sans-serif, ~1.1–1.2rem
* Name/role: smaller badge in bubble header (not intrusive)

4. Superhuman — Microinteractions, Keyboard Workflow
Interaction:
* All key actions animate:
    * Button clicks = color pulse or ripple
    * Sending a message = arrow icon “flies”
    * Modal/dialogs = fade/scale pop
* Command palette: Cmd+K or / brings up overlay with smart suggestions
* Focus states: Bold, colored outline or glow when input/button is active
* Feedback:
    * Instant (loading spinner, checkmark when done, gentle shake for error)
Typography:
* Command palette: bold, spaced, high-contrast
* UI: Inter or similar, slightly larger than default

5. Vercel Dashboard — File Previews & Drag/Drop
File Cards:
* Pill/rounded cards for each file (not tables)
* File type icon, file name bold, status badge (color-coded, animated for parsing/loading)
* Actions: Preview, Remove, Download as icon buttons on card
Drag/Drop:
* Dragging a file:
    * Overlay blurs background, dashed border appears, “Drop files to upload” text animates
* Upload:
    * Progress bar fills in card
    * Parsing = shimmer animation
    * Error = red banner/shake
Modal Preview:
* Click file card → modal floats center, shows file/image preview, actions on top/right
Typography:
* Same modern sans-serif, file names bold, status badges slightly smaller, all text high-contrast

Brand Layer to Apply to All
* Accent Color: Deep electric purple (#9147ff), or as chosen—use for active elements, buttons, status glows
* Backgrounds: Soft white/slate, light glass blur on overlays
* Shadows: Subtle but layered (not flat)
* Font: Inter (headings bold, body regular)
* Spacing: Let every element breathe—don’t crowd UI!

What To Tell Your Dev/Designer
* “Make every component feel ‘alive’: animate in, hover, and on error/success.
* Sidebar should have a glassy, modern vibe—never feel heavy.
* Chat should look like a ‘modular bot command center’—bubbles are distinct per agent, with playful but pro icons and colors.
* File management is cards, not tables—parsing/upload status is always visual and immediate.
* Everything should feel fast—even when loading, show shimmer, pulsing, or a spinner.
* Don’t skimp on padding or font size—err on the side of ‘modern SaaS’ not legacy admin tool.”
